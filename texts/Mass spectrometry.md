There are four key stages in the process for Mass Spectrometry.
1. Ionisation  
2. Acceleration
3. Deflection
4. Detection

1. Electro Ionisation is the most common type of ionisation.
2. Acceleration is a simple step where the ions are placed between a set of charges parallel plates. 
3. Ions are deflected by the magnetic field surrounding the instrument. The amount of deflection depends on the mass and charge of the ions. The amount of deflection depends on the mass and charge of the ions. F = B * q * v ( sin(<theta>) is 1)
4. Detector
